### Considerations
- Ensure easy navigation between screens (back buttons, clear paths).
- Keep the UI intuitive, focusing on a clean layout with plenty of visual elements.
- Use local storage (Room) effectively for managing favorites and weekly meals.
- Plan your data models carefully to accommodate meals, ingredients, and categories.

This structure should provide a solid starting point for designing your application’s flow. As you develop each component, consider user experience and how each screen connects to create a cohesive application.
